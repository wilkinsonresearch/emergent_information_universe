# Wilkinson Emerging Information Universe

The Wilkinson Emerging Information Universe Project is an interdisciplinary initiative exploring how local collapse events, memory feedback, and vector dynamics can give rise to emergent phenomena in a simulated universe. This project offers a “toy” model to illustrate how an underlying informational scaffold might shape dynamics resembling gravity, magnetism, and more.

## Overview

The project posits that reality may be viewed as an emergent computation—a constantly evolving information landscape where:
- **Collapse Events** resolve quantum uncertainty and inject energy into the system.
- **Memory Feedback** records past events and biases the evolution of the field.
- **Repulsive Vector Dynamics** prevent runaway buildup by redirecting flows, leading to structures that may resemble gravitational wells or magnetic fields.

By simulating these processes, the project aims to spark discussion and research into unified models of physics and computation.

## Project Components

- **Simulations:**  
  The simulation code (located in the `simulations/` folder) demonstrates various features of the WEIU theory. Detailed documentation for each simulation is available in the [docs/](docs/) folder.

- **Blogs & Documentation:**  
  The [blogs/](blogs/) folder hosts drafts and posts that explain the theoretical concepts behind the simulation.

- **Notebooks:**  
  The [notebooks/](notebooks/) directory offers interactive Jupyter notebooks that provide further demonstrations and analysis of the simulation results.
